   <h1>Schwarma in the Motor City</h1>
   <img src=../img/schwarma.jpg>
   <p>Schwarma has to be one of the most predominant foods that I have seen throughout my time here in the Mitten. Dearborn (neighboring town about 20 minutes over) has the second highest concentraition of Arabic people in the world, outside of the Middle East of course. All my coworkers have told me this, so if its wrong, blame those guys. One of my favorite parts of cultural diversity in the area, is the wide variety of traditional food that you get to try. Schwarma is one of those dishes. So unbutton your pants and get ready to smash some Schwarma. </p>
